House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark went to King's landing where he made lots of friends and lived
happily ever after...  He definitely didn't get axe murdered.

Ned stark retired from politics and opened up a donut stand.

Ned's donut stand was an incredible success, the people of Westeros loved donuts so much that they stopped cutting body parts off of other people and lived in relative peace and donut harmony for a thousand years.
